# Assessment-Hardening

In this, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, used Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, I interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I've successfully performed.

Objectives:

Apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:


Penetration testing with Kali Linux.


Log and incident analysis with Kibana.


System hardening and configuration.


Reporting, documentation, and communication.


Lab Environment
